# MCL

A language that compiles into Minecraft functions!

---

This project is still very much a work in progress so the documentation is non-existent and the code is bad.

For now, check out the `example-lang` directory, especially [`example-lang/example.mcl`](./example-lang/example.mcl)
which is a working implementation of Deathswap written in MCL. You might be able to write other things in MCL, but it's 
still pretty limited.
